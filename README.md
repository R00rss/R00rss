### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
my name is Ronny Garcia and I'm studying engineering in computer science. As a full stack developer, I have experience working with a variety of languages and technologies. My main languages are Python and JavaScript, but I also have knowledge of C, C++, Java, and Go.

On the front-end, I have two years of experience using React where I learned to use custom hooks, Redux, React Router, and how to deploy using Vite. On the back-end, I have knowledge using Node.js with Express and FastAPI, as well as Flask with Python. When it comes to databases, I have experience with MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebase, and MongoDB.

I also have knowledge in AI, including training models using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow Keras. In addition to programming, I love creating beautiful designs using CSS, Sass, and Tailwind. I enjoy using my creativity to make web applications that not only function well, but also look great.
